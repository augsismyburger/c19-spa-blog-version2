I learned how to effectively use the console and git with no previous knowledge on the subject. This was about the only Team Treehouse video that I didn't make it through. I also jumped to the more difficult javascript exercises after getting bored working with HTML. I had a ton of questions, but I managed to make to programs that work to the desired effect. I'm not getting as much done at home as I would like, but I am generally happy with my current status.",

        "text" : "Week two has been a trip. I have become very comfortable with the git system. I don't necessarily like it, but I get it. I have nearly completed all the exercises for the first milestone and feel comfortable with most of this baseline skills in HTML CSS and javascript. I spent most of the week working on my flexbox skills. I didn't get to work with javascript as much as I would have liked, but overall I am satisfied with my progress through this week. Also, I'm getting into my first team lead, so we shall see how that goes.",

        "text" : "This is definitely a process of elation and frustration. I wake up study, go to class, study, and if I'm feeling good go home and study. Socializing with classmates seems to keep me sane. This weeks work has been mostly javascript with some Materialize thrown in. The javascript portion is a slow process. I am much more comfortable with arrays and event listeners. Also, I learned to spell listener correctly on a regular basis. I started the week with... well i can't remember. I've been trying to push as many projects as possible, and they all seem to be blending in together. Oh yes, I created my first single page application for music history. That was neat. My goals currently are to push 3 to 4 more javascript exercises before Monday.",

I'm satisfied with how far I've come, but with that comes a drive to push even more. We're not encouraged to worry about where we are in relation to our classmates, but I'm not on top. And I want to be. This week I've been able to get a firm grasp on XHR requests and combing though the data. IIFE's were also covered this week. I could certainly use a bit more work on them. I have managed to complete a few of the exercises for them, but I would like to have a better mental image of how they work. Here's to one Month and pressing on.",

This week has brought with me the wisdom that I can accomplish significantly more if I shut myself in a coffee shop at six in the am. In other news, I figured out IIFE's and secured a grasp in JQUERY. I also learned some basics in Firebase. This week has not been without struggle though. My team for the Chatty app was a but ahead of me in their knowledge base. I pushed through and learned the material. I didn't help out as much as I would have liked, but I did learn the material, which is what matters in the end. Overall another nice week. Keep it real Horse-Holes..",
